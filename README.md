The Startup Jigsaw - Pieces
=========================================================

Startup insights and nuggets from various sources. Find

## The Archetype Startup
**Note: This is just an experiment of putting together the many startup jigsaw pieces in order to see if it can form some kind of framework for a successful startup. It's a constant work in progress, so don't just jump aboard without thinking.**

The prototypical successful startup seems to think and act in the following ways:

**The initial Idea should...**

1. begin as a sideproject.
2. sound crazy to others at first.
3. not start with a pivot.
4. scratch your own itch.
5. cater to one or more of your interests.
6. not clone something else out there.
7. consider the following idea evaluation criteria:

	1. Market size
	2. Market growth (is going to be big in 10 years)
	3. Growth strategy
	4. Defensibility

8. answer "Yes" to the following problem evaluation questions:

	1. "Does the problem relate to me?" (and how does it?)
	2. "Am I really passionate about that problem?"
	3. "Is it a problem that other people have?"
