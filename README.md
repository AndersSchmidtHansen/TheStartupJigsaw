The Startup Jigsaw - Pieces
=========================================================

## Uncategorized
- Piece #1: The 4 Areas of Startup Success
  
  Great idea, great product, great team and great execution. (1)

  *Note: Can Team be split up into Founder(s) and Team?*

- Piece #5: Great companies start with a great idea, not a pivot

- Piece #2: The (IxPxTxE)xL equation
  
  Startup success can be, albeit a bit humorously, calculated as the following:

  	`Idea x Product x Team x Execution x Luck`

  Where luck is a number between 0 and 10.000. (2)

  *Note: In relation to my note on Piece #1 this would add F to the equation e.g. (FxIxPxTxE)xL*


## Idea
- Piece #6: Scratch your own itch first (make stuff you yourself want) 
- Piece #7: If it's not your itch, get extremely close to those with the itch
- Piece #8: Side projects make better startups than conscious business ideas
- Piece #9: Work on stuff that interests you
- Piece #13: The best ideas always first seem crazy
- Piece #15: The specific passion should always come first, the startup second




## Product


## Founder(s)
- Piece #3: Determination trumps Intelligence
  
  It is always good to be smart, but determination seems to be the most important trait for a founder. (3)

- Piece #4: If you're not tough, your co-founder needs to be
- Piece #14: Get a co-founder



## Team


## Execution
- Piece #4: Do Things That Don't Scale
  
  Just go out and find people who desperately need your product.


## Growth
- Piece #10: Growth Hacking === Bullshit
- Piece #11: Focus on making a small amount of people love your product
- Piece #12: Make something people want, stupid
  
  *Note: The MSPWS-principle? Doesn't really roll off the tongue...*
