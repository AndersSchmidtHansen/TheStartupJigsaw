The Startup Jigsaw - Pieces
=========================================================

Startup insights and nuggets from various sources. Find

## The Archetype Startup
**Note: This is just an experiment of putting together the many startup jigsaw pieces in order to see if it can form some kind of framework for a successful startup. It's a constant work in progress, so don't just jump aboard without thinking.**

The prototypical successful startup seems to think and act in the following ways:

**The initial Idea should...**

- begin as a sideproject.
- not be a conscious startup idea.
- sound crazy to others at first.
- not start with a pivot.
- scratch your own itch.
- cater to one or more of your interests.
- not clone something else out there.
- consider the following idea evaluation criteria:

	- Market size
	- Market growth (is going to be big in 10 years)
	- Growth strategy
	- Defensibility
	- Startup monopoly potential ([#37](/../../issues/24))

- answer "Yes" to the following problem evaluation questions:

	- "Does the problem relate to me?" (and how does it?)
	- "Am I really passionate about that problem?"
	- "Is it a problem that other people have?"
