The Startup Jigsaw - Pieces
=========================================================

## Uncategorized
### Piece #1: The 4 Areas of Startup Success
Great idea, great product, great team and great execution. [^1]

*Note: Can Team be split up into Founder(s) and Team?*


### Piece #2: The (IxPxTxE)xL equation
Startup success can be, albeit a bit humorously, calculated as the following:
	
	Idea x Product x Team x Execution x Luck

Where luck is a number between 0 and 10.000. [^2]


*Note: In relation to my note on Piece #1 this would add F to the equation e.g. (FxIxPxTxE)xL*


## Idea

## Product


## Founder(s)
### Piece #3: Determination trumps Intelligence
It is always good to be smart, but determination seems to be the most important trait for a founder. [^3]


## Team


## Execution
