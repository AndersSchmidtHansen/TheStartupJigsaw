=========================================================

Startup insights and nuggets from various sources. Find

## The Archetype Startup
**Note: This is just an experiment of putting together the many startup jigsaw pieces in order to see if it can form some kind of framework for a successful startup. It's a constant work in progress, so don't just jump aboard without thinking.**

The prototypical successful startup seems to think and act in the following ways and you can evaluate your own by asking "and do/did I/we [insert thing from list here] ?":


**The Idea should...**

- [x] begin as a sideproject
- [x] not be a conscious startup idea
- [x] sound crazy to others at first
- [x] not start with a pivot
- [x] preferably scratch your own itch
- [x] cater to one or more of your interests
- [x] not clone something else out there
- [x] consider the following idea evaluation criteria:

	- [x] Market size
	- [x] Market growth (is going to be big in 10 years)
	- [x] Growth strategy
	- [x] Defensibility
	- [x] Startup monopoly potential ([#37](/../../issues/24))
	- [x] Difficulty of replication ([#21](/../../issues/21))

- [x] answer "Yes" to the following problem evaluation questions:

	- [x] "Does the problem relate to me?" (and how does it?)
	- [x] "Am I really passionate about that problem?"
	- [x] "Is it a problem that other people have?"

- [x] be very easy to explain and understand


**The Founder(s) should...**

- [x] not be terrified of starting a startup
- [x] be more than 1, preferably between 2 and 3
- [x] include a technical co-founder
- [x] include a James Bond-ish co-founder ([#61](/../../issues/61))
- [x] be tough and calm or have a co-founder that is
- [x] have domain expertise
- [x] always do sales and support in the beginning
- [x] split equity evenly and early
- [x] understand basic management skills
- [x] know each other well (and never be random)
- [x] be more determined than intelligent
- [x] praise their team
- [x] agree on that 100% equity takes 4 years (starting after 1 year) within two weeks
- [x] not (or stop) "playing house" ([#48](/../../issues/48))
- [x] trust their instincts about people
- [x] not stop talking about growing
- [x] immerse themselves into their industry
- [x] accept that the startup will take over their lives
- [x] accept that startups cannot be gamed
- [x] have a lot of time on their hands to focus on the startup
- [x] only focus on 2-3 things a day
- [x] not micromanage
- [x] give more equity to their employees than to investors
- [x] give ~10% of the company to the first 10 employees


**The CEO should...**

**The Product should...** 

- [x] start simple and one (or few) thing(s) really well
- [x] start with the smallest feature set needed to solve the problem
- [x] solve your own problem
- [x] be loved by your users, not just liked
- [x] be optimized based on a certain corner of the customer base (in the beginning)
- [x] be made great before creating its growth machine
- [x] get early feedback from hand-recruited users
- [x] get 10% better every week
- [x] solve an immediate user need
- [x] focus on generic cases, not edge cases
- [x] have a one-liner ready before showing off
- [x] include a clear way of contacting you
- [x] not be Frankensteined ([#120](/../../issues/120))
- [x] focus on minimizing the Chamath Palihapitiya Cycle ([#18](/../../issues/18)) from days to milliseconds:
	
	- [x] "What is the thing people are here to do?"
	- [x] "What is the aha moment they want?"
	- [x] "Why can't I not give that to them as fast as possible?"

- [x] be iteratively improved through personal, conversational user feedback


**The Team should...**
