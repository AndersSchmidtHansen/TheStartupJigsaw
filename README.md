The Startup Jigsaw - Pieces
=========================================================

Startup insights and nuggets from various sources. Find
them in the [Issues Area](https://github.com/AndersSchmidtHansen/thestartupjigsaw/issues).


## The Archetype Startup
**Note: This is just an experiment of putting together the many startup jigsaw pieces in order to see if it can form some kind of framework for a potentially successful tech startup. It's a constant work in progress, so don't just jump aboard without thinking. Also, most of this is relevant to startups who have yet to find product/market fit, so young startups are the focal point here.**

## The Methodology
Is pretty straihtforward. Take pieces of the TONS of startup advice out there and smash them together here in order to (maybe) discover patterns. 


## Without any furthe ado.

The prototypical successful startup seems to think and act in the following ways":


**The Idea...**

- [x] begins as a sideproject
- [x] is not a conscious startup idea
- [x] sounds crazy to others at first
- [x] does not start with a pivot
- [x] preferably scratches your own itch
- [x] caters to one or more of your interests
- [x] is not a clone something else out there
- [x] considers the following idea evaluation criteria:

	- [x] Market size
	- [x] Market growth (is going to be big in 10 years)
	- [x] Growth strategy
	- [x] Defensibility
	- [x] Startup monopoly potential ([#37](/../../issues/24))
	- [x] Difficulty of replication ([#21](/../../issues/21))

- [x] answers "Yes" to the following problem evaluation questions:

	- [x] "Does the problem relate to me?" (and how does it?)
	- [x] "Am I really passionate about that problem?"
	- [x] "Is it a problem that other people have?"

- [x] always do sales and support in the beginning
- [x] split equity evenly and early
- [x] understand basic management skills

**The Product...** 

- [x] starts simple and does one (or few) thing(s) really well
- [x] starts with the smallest feature set needed to solve the problem
- [x] solves your own problem
- [x] is loved by your users, not just liked
- [x] is optimized based on a certain corner of the customer base (in the beginning)
- [x] is made great before creating its growth machine
- [x] gets early feedback from hand-recruited users
- [x] gets 10% better every week
- [x] solves an immediate user need
- [x] is something you know people want, not just something you think would want
- [x] focuses on generic cases, not edge cases

- [x] is not Frankensteined ([#120](/../../issues/120))
- [x] focuses on minimizing the Chamath Palihapitiya Cycle ([#18](/../../issues/18)) from days to milliseconds:
	
	- [x] "What is the thing people are here to do?"
	- [x] "What is the aha moment they want?"
	- [x] "Why can't I not give that to them as fast as possible?"

- [x] is iteratively improved through personal, conversational user feedback


**The Team...**

- [x] is as small as possible
- [x] is not remote

- [x] always keeps momentum

- [x] is based of things that don't scale


**Not yet organized**
- [x] Don’t ever let yourself feel like you’ve won before you have.
- [x] Don't waste time on fake work, e.g speaking at conferences, talking to the media, or rearchitecting their infrastructure.
- [] keep burn rate at a minimum until you've achieved a product people love.
- [] every day, figure out 2-3 things that are the most important and do those. Ignore distractions.
- [] have a strategy.
