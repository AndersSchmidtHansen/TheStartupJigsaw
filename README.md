The Startup Jigsaw - Pieces
=========================================================

Startup insights and nuggets from various sources. Find
them in the [Issues Area](https://github.com/AndersSchmidtHansen/thestartupjigsaw/issues).


## The Archetype Startup
**Note: This is just an experiment of putting together the many startup jigsaw pieces in order to see if it can form some kind of framework for a successful startup. It's a constant work in progress, so don't just jump aboard without thinking.**

The prototypical successful startup seems to think and act in the following ways:

**The initial Idea should...**

- [x] begin as a sideproject.
- [x] not be a conscious startup idea.
- [x] sound crazy to others at first.
- [x] not start with a pivot.
- [x] scratch your own itch.
- [x] cater to one or more of your interests.
- [x] not clone something else out there.
- [x] consider the following idea evaluation criteria:

	- [x] Market size
	- [x] Market growth (is going to be big in 10 years)
	- [x] Growth strategy
	- [x] Defensibility
	- [x] Startup monopoly potential ([#37](/../../issues/24))

- [x] answer "Yes" to the following problem evaluation questions:

	- [x] "Does the problem relate to me?" (and how does it?)
	- [x] "Am I really passionate about that problem?"
	- [x] "Is it a problem that other people have?"
